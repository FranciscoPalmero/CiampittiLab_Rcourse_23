# Guidelines  
Use R markdown to complete your assignment. Please provide all the code to make your work reproducible.  

# 1. Data structures    
## 1.1. Create a new chuck below this text. Then create a vector called `v1` with three elements, where all the elements are characters (i.e., enclosed in single ” or double "" quotes). Print the values.  

## 1.2. Create a vector `v2` that derives from `v1`, but is of class `factor`. Print the values. Change the order of the levels of the factor (to any random order you want) and print the values.  

## 1.3. Create a list `l1` that contains `v1`, `v2` and an additional object of class "data.frame".  

# 2. Reading and saving files, accesing elements    
## 2.1. Tillage  
Read the file `tillage.csv` from the "data" folder.  

### 2.1.a.  
What is the mean pH value?  

### 2.1.b.  
Create a new column, Tmean, as the average between Tmax and Tmin, and compare it with Tave. Visualize the differences using `hist()`.   

### 2.1.c.  
Which years are contained in this dataset? (Hint: use function `unique`)   

### 2.1.d.  
How many observations are there per year? And per location?  

### 2.1.e.  
How many columns refer exclusively to no-till (i.e. have "NT" in it, but not "CT")? An "soil"?  

## 2.2. USDA Census  
Read the file `USDAsurvey_00-18.csv` from the "data" folder.     

### 2.2.a.  
Create a dataframe that has columns describing: state, county, year, state, average annual yield (US level), average annual yield (state level), and historic standard deviation of yield (state level) (Hint: check out `sd()`).  

### 2.2.b.  
Using the data frame above, which are the states with higher and lower variability in yield? Provide the top 3 of each. What are the environmental conditions in these states?  

### 2.2.c.  
Take the first dataset (with raw data) and keep only the rows where the yield is greater than the historical US average.  

# 3. Find the error  

```{r errs, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% # this is a dataset that is included in RStudio 
  rownames_to_column("model") %>% 
  fliter(mpg>15)
```


```{r errs2, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column("model") %>%
  mutate(p = hp/wt)

mtcars %>% rename(Model = model)
```

```{r errs3, eval = FALSE}
mtcars %>% 
  rownames_to_column("model") %>%
  filter(model %in% c(Hornet Sportabout, 
                      Duster 360,
                      Merc 230))
```

Improve the style:  
```{r errs4, eval = FALSE}
1a = mtcars%>%filter(vs!=am&disp<150)  
```
